# About the Project
Accident Detection and Traffic Management System
The Accident Detection and Traffic Management System is an intelligent solution that integrates accident detection and traffic management using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system utilizes advanced object detection algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), to monitor and analyze traffic in real-time. By processing video feeds, the system can detect accidents, monitor traffic flow, and optimize signal timings for improved road safety and traffic management.

This project was trained with a custom dataset of 1,500 images, which includes various scenarios like vehicle collisions, pedestrian crossings, and abnormal traffic behaviors. The system helps to identify accidents or potential hazards on the road as they occur and can also support dynamic traffic control, improving the efficiency and safety of urban transportation systems
